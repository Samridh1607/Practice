This repository contains my answer solutions to The Python Workbook: A brief introduction with exercises and solutions by Ben Stephenson. The book has 174 questions related to basics of Python programming which are as follows:
1) Conditional statements
2) Loops
3) Functions in python
4) Built in data structures in Python(Lists and Dictionaries)
5) File and Exception
6) Recursion
The code file contains both questions and answers for better readability. Upon solving all the questions, a programmer will be able to practice and implement fundamentals of Python programming easily. For suggestions, please contact me @khanejasamridh@gmail.com
